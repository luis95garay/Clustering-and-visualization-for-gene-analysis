# Clustering-and-visualization-for-gene-analysis
This notebook presents the approach for a data science project utilizing clurstering algorithms. These tasks are part of the course titled "Data Analysis: Statistical Modeling and Computation in Applications." from MIT. The notebook includes an analysis performed on single-cell RNA-seq dataset

# Dataset
We analyze a single-cell RNA-seq dataset, with the goal of unveiling hierarchical structure and discovering important genes. The datasets provided are all different subsets of a larger single-cell RNA-seq dataset, compiled by the Allen Institute. This data contains cells from the mouse neocortex, a region in the brain which governs higher-level functions such as perception and cognition.
